This GitHub Action creates a new run on Terraform Cloud. Integrate Terraform Cloud into your GitHub Actions workflow.

This action creates runs using [the Terraform Cloud API][tfe-api] which provides more flexibility than using the CLI. Namely, you can:
- define your own message (no more _"Queued manually using Terraform"_)
- provide as many variables as you want
- access the outputs from the Terraform state

Internally, we leverage [the official Go API client from Hashicorp][go-tfe].

## How to use it

```yaml
- uses: kvrhdn/tfe-run@v1
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.TFE_TOKEN }}
    workspace: tfe-run
    message: |
      Run triggered using tfe-run (commit: ${{ github.SHA }})
  id: tfe-run

... next steps can access the run URL with ${{ steps.tfe-run.outputs.run-url }}
```

Full option list:

```yaml
- uses: kvrhdn/tfe-run@v1
  with:
    # Token used to communicate with the Terraform Cloud API. Must be a user or
    # team api token.
    token: ${{ secrets.TFE_TOKEN }}

    # Name of the organization on Terraform Cloud. Defaults to the GitHub
    # organization name.
    organization: kvrhdn

    # Name of the workspace on Terraform Cloud.
    workspace: tfe-run

    # Optional message to use as name of the run.
    message: |
      Run triggered using tfe-run (commit: ${{ github.SHA }})

    # The directory that is uploaded to Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, defaults
    # to the repository root. Respsects .terraformignore. Note: this is
    # prefixed to the "Terraform Working Directory" in the remote workspace
    # settings.
    directory: integration/

    # The type of run, allowed options are 'plan', 'apply' and 'destroy'.
    type: apply

    # An optional list of resource addresses to target. Should be a list of
    # strings separated by new lines.
    #
    # For more information about resource targeting, check https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/plan.html#resource-targeting
    targets: |
        resource.name

    # Whether we should wait for the plan or run to be applied. This will block
    # until the run is finished.
    wait-for-completion: true

    # The contents of a auto.tfvars file that will be uploaded to Terraform
    # Cloud. This can be used to set Terraform variables.
    tf-vars: |
      run_number = ${{ github.run_number }}
      service    = "example"

    # The address of the Terraform Enterprise API
    terraform-host: "https://app.terraform.io"

  # Optionally, assign this step an ID so you can refer to the outputs from the
  # action with ${{ steps.<id>.outputs.<output variable> }}
